    <h2>Global Climate</h2>
    <h3>Warming trend:</h3> 
    <h4>
    The Earth’s average surface temperature has risen about 1.2 °C since the late 1800s, mostly due to human activity (burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture).
  
    </h4>

    <h3>Poles & ice:</h3> 
    <h4>
    The Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the global average, causing sea ice loss, melting glaciers, and rising seas. Antarctica is also losing ice, though less evenly.
    
    <h4>
    
    <h3>Extreme weather:</h3>
    <h4>
    Heatwaves, heavy rainfall, droughts, and stronger storms are becoming more frequent and intense.
   
    </h4>

    <h3>Ecosystems: </h3>
    <h4>
    Rising temperatures threaten food production, biodiversity, and health (heat stress, vector-borne diseases).
  
    </h4>

    <h3>Current outlook: <h3>
    <h4>
    If emissions continue at present levels, the world is on track for ~2.5–3 °C warming by 2100. The Paris Agreement aims to limit warming to 1.5 °C, but global action isn’t yet on track.
